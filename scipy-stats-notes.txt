From documentation for scipy.stats:

Import packages:
from scipy import stats

Get list of available methods for an object (a distribution for example):
dir(random_variable_name)

Common methods:
- rvs:  random variates (pull samples from a distribution)
- pdf:  probability density function
- cdf:  cumulative density function
- (isf or) sf:  (inverse) survival function (defined as one minus cdf)
- ppf:  percent point function (inverse of CDF; find value for which distribution area to left is some value )
- common statistical measures:  mean, variance, Fisher's skew, Fisher's kurtosis
- moment:  non-central moments of the distribution

Some examples: 
scipy.stats.norm.cdf(0)  Return cumulative distribution of the standard normal distribution between negative infinity and 0; can pass arrays as well

Continuous distributions take 'loc' and 'scale' arguments.  For a normal distribution, they specify mean and standard deviation, respectively.
