Changing awesome theme:

Themes stored in /usr/share/awesome/themes

Change things by editting:
beautiful.init(gears.filesystem.get_themes_dir() .. "zenburn/theme.lua")
ex. replace zenburn with default, gtk, etc.

default gray/black; 
gtk-orange; 
sky light blue; 
xresources purple black
zenburn gray/green;

Can rename tag names (from 1 ... 9) by awful.tag region in rc.lua

Git-pulled awesome themes from https://github.com/lcpz/awesome-copycats

Added gnome-screenshot to rc.lua.  Also tried Flameshot and scrot.



To do in AWM:
Layout icon color
Screen Brightness
Xorg.conf
Awful.spawn.once working properly
Standardize theming (pcman, flameshot using light theme)
Remove clock, power, and volume widgets from secondary monitor




Screen Lock - installed i3lock
Network manager - addressed with nm-applet
Bluetooth - addressed with blueman-applet
Increase volume max above 100% - achievable via pasystray (pulse audio system tray utility)



Some keyboard shortcuts (generally defaults)
* Alt j/K:  Toggle focus between windows on workspace
* CTRL + Super + Space:  Toggle floating
* Alt + Super + j/k:  Change horizontal spacing of windows
* Shift + Super + j/k:  Move window to previous/next index
