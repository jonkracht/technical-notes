#### Autostart

Programs to be ran when systems boots
* Specific user: `~/.config/autostart/` directory
* All users:  `/etc/xdg/autostart/`


#### Trash

Trashed files go to `~/.local/share/Trash/`

Empty trash:
* Graphical file managers (like nautilus) often have an option to do so
* Command line:  `rm -rf ~/.local/share/Trash/*`


`trash-cli` is a command line utility for trash management.





### Drive management (mounting, information, etc.)

lsblk

Find available drives and their locations
`sudo fdisk -l`

Mount with
`sudo mount [/PATH/TO/DEVICE] [/PATH/TO/MOUNT/POINT]`

May need to specify filesystem type of drive as well.




### Get computer hardware information

Hardware overview:	`lshw`

CPU architecture:  `lscpu`

PCI devices:	`lspci`

Graphics card:	`lspci | grep VGA`
Alternatively:	`lshw -C video`



### Change user shell

First, determine available shells:
`cat /etc/shells` or `chsh -l`


Three methods:

1.)  usermod command

`sudo usermod --shell [/PATH/TO/SHELL] [USER_NAME]`

2.)  chsh utility

`chsh -s [/PATH/TO/SHELL]`


3.)  Edit `/etc/passwd` file

Entries are of the form:
`[USER_NAME]:x:1000:1000:[FULL_USER_NAME]:[/PATH/TO/USER/HOME]:[/PATH/TO/SHELL]`

Locate user of entry for the desired user and edit `[/PATH/TO/SHELL]`



### User groups

In the terminal, the `groups` command will list groups the current user is in.
Get the groups of another user:  `groups [USER_NAME]`



### Power management

Controlled by gsettings

Get values of all gsettings:  `gsettings list-recursively`


Set:  `gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power sleep-inactive-battery-type 'shutdown'`

For power, can set inactive timeout period, lid close action, function to perform when timedout, can choose different actions for times when computer is on AC power or battery




### Creation of the bashrc

Template bashrc is contained in `/etc/skel`
All files in this directory are copied to a new user's home directory when the account is created.
These template files are somewhat distribution specific.
