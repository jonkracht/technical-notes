## TODO
* Xorg.conf
* Awful.spawn.once working properly
* Remove clock, power, and volume widgets from secondary monitor
* Autosuspend
* Menu displays are transparent
* Send audio through HDMI port when connecting to other monitors
* Layout icon color (less/not important since current config only uses one layout and hides icons)
* Exclude screen saver windows from picom rounded frames
* Volume control doesn't work for headphones
* Theming for Vscodium is light



## TODone ("solved" issues)

* Screenshot (PrtScr mapped to flameshot but also tried gnome tool and scrot)
* Screen locking: i3lock
* Manage WIFI:  nm-applet
* Facilitate bluetooth usage:  blueman-applet
* Increase volume above 100% (distortion?):  Possible via Volume Control in pasystray (pulse audio system tray utility)
* Control screen brightness:  Controlled with "light" package
* Remap switching between monitors (called screens) to something more ergonomic
* Unmute audio with volume up key (addressed using amixer output to check if audio output is on)
* Standardize theming (pcman, flameshot using light theme; all QT apps?, anything else) installed kvantum to set QT theming to something consistent with other system components
