### Walls
* Create new layer:  In menu on the right, select Layer List and create a new layer by clicking the plus sign and give a name and color
* Draw outline of room, using variations of straight lines (horizontal, vertical, parallel, etc)
* To draw walls, create new layer named Walls and assign a new color, say tan.  Using the parallel line tool create a parallel line on either side of each wall segment.  Use the Trim Two command to fix corners.  Use Trim to remove excess sections.
