Works by appending virtual environment files to the beginning of PATH so executables in the virtual environment are found before those of the main system


Create a virtual environment

Navigate to desired folder
Create with:  virtualenv --python=[PYTHON_VERSION] ENVNAME

Acivate:  
source [ENVNAME]/bin/activate

Deactivate virtualenv:
deactivate

Display information about an environment:
Print packages:  pip list --OR-- pip freeze
Print outdated packages:  pip list --outdated
Print details of specific package:  pip show PACKAGE_NAME



Use a virtual environment in a Jupyter notebook:

Activate virtual environment

Install IPython kernel:  pip install ipykernel

Add virtual environment to Jupyter:
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=Insight-Env
p

-----

List environment available to Jupyter:
jupyter kernelspec list

Alternatively, details of environments are located at:
~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/


To delete an environment:
First deactivate.  Then:
sudo rm -rf <env_name>



Install specific package versions:
pip install [PACKAGE_NAME]==[PACKAGE_VERSION]


Save current environment (e.g. python packages and specific versions) to a text file
pip freeze > requirements.txt


Create a virtual environment using a requirement file (a text file containing desired packages and version numbers):
pip install -r requirements.txt
