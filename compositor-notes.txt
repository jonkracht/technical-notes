* Transparency
* Transition animations
* Drop shadows behind windows

Some window manages perform their own compositing (ex. Mutter)

Consumes some amount of system resources so not ideal for gaming

Some Linux compositors
* Compton
* Picom

Configuration is done via a .conf file



picom has difficulty rendering blur
tryone144 fork uses Kawase blur to achieve more efficiently
