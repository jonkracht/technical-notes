Programs executed on system boot
* Specific user: `~/.config/autostart/` directory
* All users:  `/etc/xdg/autostart/`


## Trash

Trashed files go to `~/.local/share/Trash/`

`trash-cli` is a command line utility for trash management.





## Drive management (mounting, information, etc.)

lsblk:  List information about block devices

Find available drives and their locations
`sudo fdisk -l`

## Get computer hardware information

Hardware overview:	`lshw`

CPU architecture:  `lscpu`

PCI devices:	`lspci`

USB devices:  `lsusb`

Graphics card:	`lspci | grep VGA`
Alternatively:	`lshw -C video`



## Change user shell

First, determine available shells:
`cat /etc/shells` or `chsh -l`


Three methods:

1.)  usermod command

`sudo usermod --shell [/PATH/TO/SHELL] [USER_NAME]`

2.)  chsh utility

`chsh -s [/PATH/TO/SHELL]`


3.)  Edit `/etc/passwd` file

Entries are of the form:
`[USER_NAME]:x:1000:1000:[FULL_USER_NAME]:[/PATH/TO/USER/HOME]:[/PATH/TO/SHELL]`

Locate entry for the desired user and edit `[/PATH/TO/SHELL]`



## Group Management

### Display groups of which user is a member
* `groups [USER_NAME]`
* `id -nG [USER_NAME]`

### Add user to a group
sudo usermod -a -G [GROUP_NAME] [USER_NAME]

### Remove user from a group
`gpasswd -d [USER_NAME] [GROUP_NAME]`





## Power management

Controlled by gsettings

Get values of all gsettings:  `gsettings list-recursively`


Set:  `gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power sleep-inactive-battery-type 'shutdown'`

For power, can set inactive timeout period, lid close action, function to perform when timedout, can choose different actions for times when computer is on AC power or battery

Some flags:
* h: drives sizes shown in human-readable units
* T: include drive type in output
* x: exclude file systems of specified type from output



### du (stands for Disc Used)

Some flags:
* h for human-readable units
* --max-depth 
* s for a summary


### ncdu
