Difference between pip and pip3:
pip is used to manage packages for Python 2; pip3 is for Python 3

On Pop 22.04, only Python 3 is natively installed.
Also, pip and pip3 are linked to the same executable so should be interchangeable

pip list --outdated


Install package into version:
pip install [PACKAGE_NAME]


Upgrade already-installed package:
pip install --upgrade [PACKAGE_NAME]
