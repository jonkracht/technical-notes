# network management notes

On Pop 22.04, uses NetworkManager to configuring/operating connections.
(Alternatives include systemd-network and ifupdown)

Can turn on/off by editting /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf
Turn on by setting managed parameter to false (`managed=false`)
And vice versa for OFF

Only one networking service should be enabled at a time


## Tools included with NetworkManager
* nmcli command line tool for controlling NM
* nmtui - a terminal user interface (TUI)
* nm-applet - applet for GNOME desktop environments


### nmcli

* Show available WiFI `nmcli device wifi`

* Show recent (all?) past connections:  `nmcli connection show`
Include the --active flag to show available

Edit current connection parameters:  `nmcli connection modify <connect_id> <param> <val>`
* Show available wireless networks:  `nmcli device wifi`

Can abbreviate the 'connection' and 'device' flag families with 'c' and 'dev', respectively.  Abbreviations must be unique among possible flags.


### nm-applet

Automatically started by Gnome desktop.  Need to manually initialize in awesome.



## TODO

* Tool for mapping network strength spatially
